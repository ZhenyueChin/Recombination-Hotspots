recording fit curve, all populations.
NOTE: fit curve of ints, not networks, and no mod curve


4 cores, 3 seeds (total 12 final pops/datapoints)

pop size 100

gens for A: 300
gens for B: 750

selecting for ALL PAIRS not just single permutations

neglected to differentiate between first_best runs, and it includes
