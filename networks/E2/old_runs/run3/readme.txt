E2 run3. Now I have implemented xover recording, and xover only happens in second part.

Generations for A: 300 (to cut down to 100 in future runs, or maybe to exactly as many generations as it takes to reach a network of fitness 1)
generations for B: 1000 (potentially to cut down to 500-800 in future runs)

HUGE change: now working with all pairs of permutations, not just single bit permutations

Importantly, now we are actually recording data from all four possible runs... oops
