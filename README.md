# Specialization-Modularity

This is my reimplementation of the work of Espinosa-Soto and Wagner in their 2010 paper Specialization Can Drive the Evolution of Modularity. The implementation is in python, and completed under the supervision of Dr. Bongard at the University of Vermont as part of an undergraduate research project, Fall 2015
