I successfully implemented a hill climber for GRNs, but I am plagued by chaos issues. I will meet with Dr. Bongard tomorrow, but in order to find a reasonable max_cycle value (my cutoff for passing verdict on the chaotic nature of a network) I will devise a test: Initialize a sample of random new networks as in text, and run each once. I will set the cutoff to be very high, and see the distribution of cycle length. I suspect that most networks will be chaotic, and those that are not will all be relatively low, say single digits of iterations. This will give me a good cutoff point to make chaotic networks less computationally expensive.

Here are the results of my experiment, with a single fixed starting node state, and 
	pop_size=5000
	max_cycle=500
